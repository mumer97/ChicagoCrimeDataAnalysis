# Chicago Crime Data Analysis
This study focuses on finding patterns and improving prediction abilities via analyzing the Chicago crime data thoroughly using a variety of machine learning models. The dataset contains a variety of variables, such as time, place, and types of crimes. The project tackles issues like handling categorical variables and model optimization by carefully preprocessing and using models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, k-nearest Neighbors, and Neural Networks. The evaluation criteria that direct the comparison of model performances include recall, accuracy, precision, and F1-score. The conclusions drawn help create a more complex picture of Chicago's crime dynamics, which helps law enforcement and urban security agencies make wise decisions. The effective use of data analytics for public safety and crime prevention in urban settings is demonstrated by this study.
